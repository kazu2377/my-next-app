I'll remove the console.log comments from the code.

```diff
  const ReservationApp = () => {
    // 状態管理
-   //Console.log
-   console.log("予約管理システム");
-   console.log(format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd"));
    
    const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<string>(
```

I see the error you're encountering - it's a React hydration error. This happens when the content rendered on the server doesn't match what's rendered on the client.

Looking at the error message and the code, the issue appears to be with the HTML lang attribute. The server is rendering with `lang="ja"` but the client is trying to render with `lang="en"`.

This type of hydration error can happen for several reasons, as shown in the error message:
- Server/client branch differences
- Variable inputs like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which change each render
- Date formatting with user locale that doesn't match server
- External data changes without sending snapshots
- Invalid HTML nesting

In your specific case, it looks like you need to ensure consistent language settings between server and client rendering.

To fix this issue, you should:

1. Add a proper HTML document setup with the correct language attribute
2. Make sure your Next.js configuration is consistent

Try adding a layout.tsx file in your app directory with the proper HTML language attribute set to Japanese:

```typescript:src/app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="ja">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

This should ensure that both server and client render with the same language setting. If you already have a layout file, make sure the language attribute is set correctly and consistently.
